Strategy:

* implement functionality enough for skype-4.3
* fully implement all inteface  provided by libpulse
* implement libpulse-simple and libpulse-mainloop-glib
* implement Debian package which could provide all client
  dependencies and get rid of pulseaudio presence in installation

First target: implement functionality enough for skype-4.3. List of functions
which skype supposedly uses is available in the skype.ltrace file. I believe
after it's done skype will work.
